# PokemonPythonDictionary
Dictionary for pokemon types for pokemon league drafting purposes
Hello everybody, This is just a project im working on for a couple of buddies who play pokemonshowdown,
The goal of the program will be to enable drafting to be a bit easier for new players and old players who want to do a pokemon league and just do it online rather than
go through the time of an excel sheet. The project will be broken down into multiple phases as such:

Phase 1: Import all Gen 1 pokemon into Pokemon Dictionary, Afterwards create functions to utilize search features for Monotypes, Create tier list organization of Pokemon
I.E (OU, UU, Ubers) based off of competitive trainer input,

Phase 2: Import arrays for individual trainers to draft(Create profiles for users), code availability of pokemon (Agency essentially) (bool values taken or no)

Phase 3: Import pictures of each pokemon and their sprites for players to know what pokemon they drafted looks like.

This is the beginning of the project however, I will develop it into flask eventually and then onto a webpage!
